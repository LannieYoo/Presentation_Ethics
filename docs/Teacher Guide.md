2. Project report guide
Page section title
Project Report – Ethical AI Impact Assessment
Purpose
Give a structured ethical assessment of the City of Ottawa GenAI Internal Research Tool, focusing on privacy, bias, transparency, accountability, and governance in a municipal setting.
Required content blocks for the report
1  Project overview and objectives


Describe the GenAI Internal Research Tool


Explain what problems it is solving for City of Ottawa staff


State the main ethical questions the report will answer


2  System background and technical context


Short description of the system architecture


Mention that the system uses LLM plus RAG


Explain at a high level
how data is ingested
how retrieval works
how generation is produced for users


3  Stakeholder mapping


Identify key stakeholders
city employees using the tool
IT and data governance teams
municipal leaders and policy makers
Ottawa residents affected by decisions
vendors or external partners if relevant


For each stakeholder group
describe expected benefits of the tool
describe potential risks or harms


4  Data flow and sensitive information


Describe the data-flow for the GenAI tool
where data comes from
how it is stored
how it moves into the RAG pipeline


Highlight where sensitive or confidential information may appear


Explain how access control and authorization are supposed to work


Connect to municipal privacy concerns
for example MFIPPA and related regulations


5  Ethical risk analysis


Identify and analyze at least three to five major ethical risks in this specific context
examples
privacy and confidentiality risks
bias and fairness in retrieved sources and model outputs
transparency and explainability of summaries
accountability when AI-generated content influences decisions
intellectual property and use of internal documents


For each risk
describe the issue in this municipal setting
give at least one realistic scenario or case example
discuss potential impact on residents, staff, and public trust


6  Risk register for the GenAI tool


Present a structured view of the main risks


For each risk
give a short description
likelihood level such as low, medium, high
impact level such as low, medium, high
short note on why the likelihood and impact are rated that way


Make clear that this register is specific to the City of Ottawa GenAI tool, not generic AI


7  Regulatory and policy context


Summarize key regulations and policies that apply
examples
MFIPPA
AODA
internal City of Ottawa policies on data protection and information security if available


Explain how these regulations shape acceptable design choices for the GenAI tool


Connect at least some of the identified risks to regulatory obligations


8  Ethical tools and mitigation strategies


Choose specific tools or frameworks that can help manage the risks
examples
algorithmic fairness tools such as AIF360
Model Cards or System Cards
differential access controls and logging
human in the loop review processes


For each tool or strategy
explain exactly how it would be applied to this system
link it to the risk register items it mitigates
mention limitations and remaining challenges


9  Governance workflow and accountability


Describe a governance workflow for deploying and maintaining the GenAI tool
who reviews new datasets
who approves model updates
who monitors usage logs and incidents
how issues are escalated and resolved


Clarify accountability
roles such as system owners, AI developers, data protection officers, policy owners, and end users


Show how this workflow supports responsible use in a public sector environment


10  Recommendations and guidelines


Provide clear, actionable recommendations for the City of Ottawa team
examples
guidelines for data selection and redaction
procedures for bias auditing and monitoring
user interface guidance such as confidence indicators and warnings
training and documentation for staff


Prioritize recommendations
short list of high impact, must do actions
remaining recommended improvements


11  Conclusion


Summarize the overall ethical assessment of the GenAI tool


Highlight the most critical risks and strongest opportunities


Restate why responsible deployment matters for residents and public trust


12  References


Use academic and industry sources about
generative AI governance
public sector AI
privacy, bias, accountability, and evaluation of LLM systems


Use APA format for citations and reference list
